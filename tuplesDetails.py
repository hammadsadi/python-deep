fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "apple")
# print(fruits[2])

# Count the number of times the value "apple" appears in the tuple:
# print(fruits.count("apple"))

#  Index of the first occurrence of the value "cherry":
# print(fruits.index("banana"))


#  Convert the tuple into a list to be able to modify it:
# print(list(fruits))

#  Slice the tuple to get a new tuple with the first three items:
# print(fruits[0:3])
# print(fruits[:3])

#  Loop through the items in the tuple and print them:
for item in fruits:
    print(item)
